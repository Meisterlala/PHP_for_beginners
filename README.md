# PHP Demo Website
[![Better Stack Badge](https://uptime.betterstack.com/status-badges/v2/monitor/1kdio.svg)](https://php-demo.nekofans.net/) [php-demo.nekofans.net](https://php-demo.nekofans.net/)


This project is part of my journey in mastering PHP, web development, and database management, inspired by my coursework from the [Laracasts PHP Path](https://laracasts.com/series). It showcases a collection of projects that highlight my skills in designing responsive, user-friendly websites, integrating back-end functionality, and managing data with MySQL.

By exploring this demo, you'll gain insight into how I approach full-stack development using modern PHP practices, following best coding standards, and utilizing tools like Docker to streamline workflows.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Web Pages:** Developed using PHP, implementing routing and session handling to create dynamic and interactive user experiences.
- **Database Integration:** Projects include examples of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with Postgress databases.
- **Deployment-Ready:** The project is easily deployable with Docker and can be run seamlessly in any development environment using GitHub Codespaces.
